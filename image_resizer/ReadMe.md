# Rust Image Resizing tool

I run a [blog for beer](https://www.beerbuddies.co.uk) and it's slow because I use the raw JPEGs off of my phone

I wanted to experiment with more Rust, this was an opportunity

## Build

`cargo build` should do it

## Run 

I've been running the exe from the cargo build step

## Test

No tests (see no evil)

# Motivation

Basically the site was doggerdly slow and I couldn't have that (it costs more to server more over a CDN) so to cost me less and get a faster site I knew I needed a tool to skrink images.

I've been wanting to experiment with Rust for a long time, this seemed like an opportunity.
